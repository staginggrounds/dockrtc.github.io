title: What's DockRTC?
---

[DockRTC](http://dockrtc.com) is a helper of sorts. A courier for your carryings, and a carrier of goodwill. Its always there when you need it and never when you don't. Double Blind taste tests agree the 'Dock' is just cool for enabling safe and private communications, in a uniquely convenient and omnipresent fashion, if you desire it so. 

> Rich Media
For that discriminating palate that demands more Bringing the powerful and newest elements of the HTML 5 spec, and other projects in current browsers, LXC Containership from Linux, [adPush.me](http://adPush.me) / [adPush.org](http://adPush.org) Foundations too secret to discuss, Rich Media, and a shit-ton of creativity, its a revolution in ease of communication, a delightful centerpiece to entertain, a helpful assistant to locate and store things, optionally even a security filter to watch over transactions and keep you safely entertained and in touch with the world. 

> For real current browsers, not Dinosaurs or IE (sorry T-Rex!)

Rather than quote Paul Irish here we'll be safe and just say if you arent using new FF or Chrome hopfully its because of some compatibility with work software. If you've a technical roadblock, it is unlikely if using a PC that it is so old you cannot benefit from a better web. Use Linux, and get Chrome Beta on it. You can run LXDE on most things, ChromeOS and Android are also options for christ sake this is being typed SSH on a 256 MB Server from a $150 laptop. Computing can be cheap, consumers have to be smart about whts sexy and whats needed and find a balance. You do not need to spend $2000 because 'I  just can't live without my MacBook Trackpad', that's absurd if you are in financial shape for it.
Otherwise download them here, and now [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome/)

> Old as dirt, yet too timely for its own good?

It's based on a concept that is older than [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dockrtc) but is not ready for its full release must is delayed to be in keeping with new U.S. Homeland Security Guidelines and friendly suggestions, to which we naturally have no disagreement and the highest respect for the people who help keep our nation safe for us all read more on our [privacy polcy](./privacy):

Following Ray Anthony's 3 S's of social media apps we naturally offer a unique advantage for :

  > Searching
  > Sharing
  > Shopping

We use Open Source non-proprietary components whenever possible, which fortunately is most of the time but until such time as copyrights are used and not abused, and the playing field is truly level many technologies we produce and provide to make the service possible cannot be made at this time, regretfully, open sourced...yet.

>> ***Jekyll and Github***

Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] 
and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. 
This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.

This site made possible with Jekyll, an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

> > ***Privacy***
to enjoy and prosper as a byproduct of freedom, privacy, and minimal but appropriate antitrust enforcement. As for the DMCA and it's rampant abuse by media claims holders we hold no claim to nor take responsibility for what is transferred between users, and this holds especially true with encrypted contents. We trust our users not to abuse the power we put in their hands just as they trust us to facilitate communications without voyeuristically eavesdropping. Furthermore sharing of any information national security or otherwise will require a search warrant that can be verified prior to any access given. The privacy of the in question user and the users of our service in general are a core value to us, and we would rather disolve than betray their trust. With that said the non-private details of any warrant fake warrant or legal request of any kind will be shared on a special section of our website much like you see with chillingeffects.org but anonymized to protect the user in question but enough to make overzealous public officials think twice before needlessly invading a persons realm, and certainly our hope is to fend off any 'bluffing'. As for DMCA, we will do our post to comply with the law and respecting for artists but please understand we are an enabler of communications not a media source we are no more guilty of violating media claims and copyrights than a phone company is if somebody downloads a crappy mp3 rip of youtube over a dialup internet connection. We are not armed with a team of lawyers as big as Uber's but we are not defenseless. [the project's readme](https://github.com/dockrtc/dockrtc/blob/master/README.md)
